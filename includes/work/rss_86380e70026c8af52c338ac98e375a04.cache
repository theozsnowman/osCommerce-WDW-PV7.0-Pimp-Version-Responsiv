We're extremely proud to announce the next osCommerce Online Merchant release series is rolling out now starting with the beta release of v2.4.0 Joli! This is a developers release that has a rapid weekly release schedule to finalize the framework API and to build on to the v2.x series with quality production ready releases.<br><br>
v2.4.0 Joli Beta includes the community led effort by Gary Burton to modernize the frontend with a responsive Bootstrap template called Sail. This not only aims to improve the customer experience on the site frontend to encourage and improve sales, but also on the site backend with a more user intuitive interface to work with the business side of sales.<br><br>
The OSC\OM framework that was introduced in the v3.0 developer series has been backported and invites developers to start migrating their add-ons to the new self-contained App infrastructure that not only allows for more secure and easier installations of third-party software, but also online installations and updates through the Administration Dashboard (coming in a later beta release). This involves a tight integration into our new App Marketplace that will be launched in the near future.<br><br>
v2.4.0 will be the only public release of the v2.4 beta series -&nbsp;all weekly updates during the beta phase will be delivered through the online update feature to get the online update feature tested on as many server configurations as possible.<br><br>
There are still a lot of changes planned during the beta phase that will break the framework API and is the reason for the beta release series. All changes between releases will be documented to keep developers up-to-date and to help them finalize their Apps for the production ready release.<br><br>
We're committed to Open Source and are continuing our goal of moving from the GPL license to the MIT license. This is the first release in the v2.x series to be completely licensed under the MIT license.<br><br>

We're proud to announce the introduction of a new App endeavor with the release of PayPal App for osCommerce Online Merchant!<br><br>
We've worked in close collaboration with PayPal to not only bring you updated PayPal payment modules but have also bundled all PayPal modules, including Log In with PayPal, into a single App package for an even tighter integration with osCommerce Online Merchant to enhance both sellers and buyers experiences with PayPal.<br><br>
The PayPal App is optimized for and will be bundled with the upcoming osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3.5 release and can be installed on existing installations from v2.2RC2a to v2.3.4.<br><br>
The PayPal App has been architectured to preview and showcase the direction we are taking the new osCommerce Online Merchant v2.4 series in and how the new series will allow you to install and update Apps on your online store through the Administration Dashboard. The PayPal App includes an online update feature that can update itself with a click of a button that will be part of the core in v2.4 for all Apps to take advantage of.<br><br>
We are also extremely proud to be one of the first self-hosted e-commerce solutions to allow the PayPal App to configure itself by securely retrieving the PayPal account API Credentials for you. This is currently available for US and UK sellers and allows you to sign into or create a PayPal live or sandbox account to retrieve the API Credentials from. This makes it extremely easy for new PayPal sellers to start experiencing the PayPal payment methods through a sandbox account and to create a live account as soon as they are ready to accept payments - directly from the osCommerce Administration Dashboard.<br><br>
In addition, the PayPal App includes:<br><br>
- Updated payment modules<br>
- Payments Standard: Support for Payment Data Transfer (PDT) payments<br>
- Payments Standard: Stock management in IPN notifications<br>
- Order Administration: Capture full or partial authorizations, refund full or partial transactions<br>
- API Logging: All parameters sent in and received from API calls are logged<br><br>
Documentation for the PayPal App is available at:<br><br><a href="http://library.oscommerce.com/Package&amp;paypal">http://library.oscommerce.com/Package&amp;paypal</a><br><br>
The PayPal App can be downloaded for free at:<br><br><a href="http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/9184">http://addons.oscommerce.com/info/9184</a><br><br>
